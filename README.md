The treasure hunt is an interactive grid-based strategy game designed to challenge  players decision making and resource management skills. where players navigate a concealed 5x5 grid in search of hidden treasures. The game’s primary objective is to collect all the treasures scattered across the grid while managing limited resources, including health points, moves, and a strict 60-second timer. Players must carefully plan each move, balancing the need to uncover treasures with the risks of encountering traps and using power-ups to extend gameplay.

The grid remains hidden at the start, with unexplored cells marked as ?. As players move using directional inputs (W, A, S, D), the grid gradually reveals its contents. Each cell may contain treasures, traps, power-ups, or empty spaces. Treasures (T) reward 10 points and contribute to the main objective, while traps (X) reduce the player’s health by one point. Power-ups (+) grant an additional three moves, offering a lifeline when moves are running low. Empty cells are neutral and safe to explore.

Adding a layer of unpredictability, traps relocate randomly across the grid after each turn, requiring players to remain cautious and adapt their strategy. The game ends either when the player collects all treasures, loses all health, exhausts their moves, or the timer runs out.

The scoring system tracks the player’s performance based on treasures collected, encouraging players to replay and improve their results. A leaderboard records high scores, allowing players to compete and aim for the top rank. With its mix of exploration, risk management, and strategic decision-making, The Treasure Hunt provides a challenging yet enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels.
